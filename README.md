## Getting Started

Welcome to the our project repository. We are building a java version of a Tetris Attack style game.

As of right now there are no released, so if you want to check out our current progress you need to 
download and compile the source code for yourself.
Here is how you can do it:

### Compiling using the Maven build tools:

- Download and install the Apache Maven toolset and all its requirements from [this download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Clone this repository
- On the project root folder run the following commands:

```bash
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
```
